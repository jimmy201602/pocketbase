## Fork Explanation ❤️ Pocketbase  
[Pocketbase Documentation](https://pocketbase.io/docs)  

> Important Note: Go modules does not support module aliasing. So we changed the module name to "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase" to "github.com/AlperRehaYAZGAN/postgresbase" in go.mod file and all imported package prefixes. You could change it back to "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase" if you want to customize the project.  


Pocketbase is a great product and very efficient for small-mid projects. It has no any additional setup for any other features and it is very easy to use on a single server.  

In our use-case we really need to use postgres as a main database and operate it manually. Also we love what Pocketbase does with CRUD operation and RBAC implementations via simple notations. So we want to use it. Thus we forked it and make it compatible with postgres using its own library called ["pocketbase/dbx"](https://github.com/pocketbase/dbx).  

We are still working on it and we will update the documentation as soon as we finish the project.  

We just added a following features additinonally to the Pocketbase:
- We use [Twitter Snowflake for ID generation](https://github.com/AlperRehaYAZGAN/postgresbase/blob/master/migrations/1640988000_init.go#L48). Every table ID is generated by postgres function as data type varchar(32)  
- We converted [created and updated columns](https://github.com/AlperRehaYAZGAN/postgresbase/blob/master/migrations/1640988000_init.go#L73-L74) to postgres native date types `TIMESTAMPTZ` to support native date operations  
- We write [json functions for postgres](https://github.com/AlperRehaYAZGAN/postgresbase/blob/master/migrations/1640988000_init.go) in migration files to support json equivalent operations from Pocketbase.  
- We add support [RSA256 JWT Public Private Keys](https://github.com/AlperRehaYAZGAN/postgresbase/blob/master/tools/security/jwt.go) while encoding and decoding token. In our case we need to implement Pocketbase to our existing project with RSA keypair. Currently (Pocketbase v0.20.5) supports symmetric encoding only and we extend it.  
- We add [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) and [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) for building and running the project.  

## TODO  
  

- [ ] OAuth2 challenge and state keys stored in cache on single instance. We need to make it remote cache or database to support oauth2 on deployed multiple instances.  
- [ ] Jwt Extra Claims support on after login and register.  

## Usage  
You can easily fork and setup the project.  

```bash
# clone and download libraries
git clone https://github.com/AlperRehaYAZGAN/postgresbase
cd postgresbase
go mod download

# docker-compose has 3 service for test pocketbase all features:
# 1. Postgres: runs on port 5432
# 1. postgres://user:pass@localhost/logs?sslmode=disable
# 2. minio: UI runs on port 9001 and API on 9000  (minio123:minio123)
# 2. s3://minio123:minio123@localhost:9000/public
# (dont forget to manually create bucket called "public" via web ui to establish s3 connection from pocketbase)
# 3. mailhog: port: SMTP-1025 and UI-8025
# 3. smtp://localhost:1025 - http://localhost:8025
docker-compose up -d

# before run the project, you need to create and set RSA Public key pair for JWT before run the application.
# you can use following command to generate RSA key pair
openssl genrsa -out ./keys/private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in ./keys/private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out ./keys/public.pem

# after generating keys, you can set as environment variables
export JWT_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat ./keys/private.pem)
export JWT_PUBLIC_KEY=$(cat ./keys/public.pem)
export CGO_ENABLED=0
exprot LOGS_DATABASE="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/logs?sslmode=disable"
export DATABASE="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/postgres?sslmode=disable"

# optional ENV_VARS
export BCRYPT_COST=10 # default is 12

# export is success you can run the project ✅
go run -tags pq ./examples/base serve  

```

### Docker

```bash
# build docker image
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t <your-name>/postgresbase:1.0.0 .  

# before running application generate RSA256 public-private key pair for jwt signing
# you can use following command to generate RSA key pair
openssl genrsa -out ./keys/private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in ./keys/private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out ./keys/public.pem

# run docker image
docker run -d --name postgresbase \
    -p 8090:8090 \
    -e LOGS_DATABASE="postgresql://user:pass@<postgres-ip>:5432/logs?sslmode=disable" \
    -e DATABASE="postgresql://user:pass@<postgres-ip>:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable" \
    -e JWT_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat $PWD/keys/private.pem)" \
    -e JWT_PUBLIC_KEY="$(cat $PWD/keys/public.pem)" \
    <your-name>/postgresbase:1.0.0
```

## Extend Pocketbase (Postgresbase)  
We just changed the database connection and added some features to Pocketbase. So you can use all features of current Pocketbase v0.25.0. You could check the [Pocketbase Documentation](https://pocketbase.io/docs) for more information. You can easily use Pocketbase as a library and extend it like shown below.  

- Install library
```bash
go get github.com/AlperRehaYAZGAN/postgresbase # go version v1.21 or higher
```

- You can use everything like Pocketbase but only change the import path
```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"os"
	"time"

	pocketbase "github.com/AlperRehaYAZGAN/postgresbase" // ! Just change the import path
	"github.com/AlperRehaYAZGAN/postgresbase/core" // ! Just change the import path
)

func main() {
	app := pocketbase.New()

	// TODO: Add your own plugins, logic or any pocketbase supported features
	// ...

	if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```  

- You could run app with following command:
```bash
# before running application generate RSA256 public-private key pair for jwt signing
# you can use following command to generate RSA key pair
openssl genrsa -out ./keys/private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in ./keys/private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out ./keys/public.pem

# set required environment variables
export JWT_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat ./keys/private.pem)
export JWT_PUBLIC_KEY=$(cat ./keys/public.pem)
export CGO_ENABLED=0
export LOGS_DATABASE="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/logs?sslmode=disable"
export DATABASE="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/postgres?sslmode=disable"

# optional ENV_VARS
export BCRYPT_COST=10 # default is 12

# run the application
go run -tags pq main.go serve --http=0.0.0.0:8090
```
